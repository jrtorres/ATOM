## Blockchain: Bring up your first network
Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts, that delivers some key differentiating capabilities over other popular distributed ledger or blockchain platforms.
Use the VSCode plugin for Hyperledger Fabric to create your developement blockchain network. Create a sample smart contract. Package, invoke and instantiate a smart contract to record a transaction into the ledger. Run queries against the ledger. 
Run `docker ps` command after the creation of the network to see the running components of the network such as peer, orderer, CA, state database etc.

#### Prerequisites:
