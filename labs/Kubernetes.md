## Kubernetes: "Kubernetes 101" Concepts
You probably heard a lot about Docker and Kubernetes. They are storming the world and providing a way to write and deploy applications very efficiently. But are you familiar with Kubernetes concepts? In this session, we will explain Kubernetes concepts and go through exercises on how to deploy Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Service, and so on.

#### Prerequisites: 
Familiarity with docker and containerization helps however it is not a must.
##### Run on IBM Cloud:
Reach out to the instructor to receive the credentials for a pre-provisioned Kubernetes cluster.

Alternatively, you can run the labs on your cluster by provisiong one on the IBM Cloud. Follow this [link](https://ibm.biz/Bd2WCn) to create your free cluster on IBM Cloud account. Select `Kubernetes Service` from the catalog and provision a lite cluster free of cost.

##### Run locally:
Install minikube on your laptop and follow the lab instructions.

#### Instructions: 
Start with [Lab 1](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/tree/master/workshop/Lab1). Note: Skip step 0, use following [instructions](./docs/ClusterLogin.md) to login to pre-provisioned clusters.</br>
Follow [Lab 2](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/tree/master/workshop/Lab2) to scale and update the deployments.</br>
Follow [Lab 3](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/tree/master/workshop/Lab3) to natively update and build multi-tier applications.

#### Call to Action
Create your Kube cluster across different availability zones to make the application disaster resistent. Try out the following patterns:</br>
