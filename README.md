Machine Learning: Monitor WML model with Watson OpenScale
IBM Watson OpenScale is an open environment that enables organizations to automate and operationalize their AI. OpenScale provides a powerful platform for managing AI and ML models. Learn how to train, create and deploy a machine learning model using Jupyter Notebook and Watson Studio. Use OpenScale to log payload and monitor performance, quality, and fairness of the model.

Prerequisites: Familiarity with Machine Learning.

Blockchain: Bring up your first network
Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts, that delivers some key differentiating capabilities over other popular distributed ledger or blockchain platforms.
Create your first blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. Learn about the architecture and various components of a blockchain network. Create and invoke a smart contract to record a transaction into the ledger. Run queries against the ledger. 

Prerequisites: Docker 17.06.2 or greater, Go 1.11.x, NodeJS 8.x

Kubernetes: "Kubernetes 101" Concepts
You probably heard a lot about Docker and Kubernetes. They are storming the world and providing a way to write and deploy applications very efficiently. But are you familiar with Kubernetes concepts? In this session, we will explain Kubernetes concepts and go through exercises on how to deploy Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Service, and so on.

Prerequisites: Familiarity with Docker and containerization

Visual recognition: Facial Age Estimator
This hands-on lab will use one of the models from the Model Asset Exchange (MAX), an exchange where developers can find and experiment with open source deep learning models. Specifically, we will be using the Facial Age Estimator to create a web application that will first detect human faces and then output the ages with the bounding boxes of the associated detected faces. The web application provides a user-friendly interface backed by a lightweight python server. The server takes webcam as input via the UI and sends them to a REST end point for the model. The model's REST endpoint is set up using the docker image provided on MAX. The Web UI displays the estimated age with the associated bounding box for each person.

Prerequisites: Familiarity with Python and Docker.
